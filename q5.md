# Q5

The bottom up approach is to brute-force all words possible from the given N numbers. Time complexity of this is O(4^N), for worst case scenario when digit 9 (WXYZ) is included. However, time complexity may be less (consider digits 2-8 have only 3 alphabets, digits 0-1 have no alphabets)

However, we can instead use a top-down approach. At the start of the program runtime, a predetermined nested set of nodes can be generated by first reading from a text file containing an english dictionary. Each Node Class will contain 
1. Array[10] of Nodes, initialised to null.
2. A Set containing all possible words (in string form).

First, we will define a root node

```
#define NUMPAD_SIZE 10

class Node 
  1. Node[] children = new Node[NUMPAD_SIZE] // Initialised to null
  2. Set(string) possibleWords

  constructor ()
    Assign possibleWords to a new empty set.

  function insert(Arg newWord)
    Add newWord to possibleWords

rootNode = new Node()
```

Then we can create a init function to generate our nested nodes. Start off by creating a set of words containing all the words in the english dictionary. (For unix you can use the word dictionary in `/usr/share/dict/words`).

Thereafter, we can can read the words one by one. While reading each word, we can (in order):
1. Loop over each character in the word, starting from the first one
2. Get the digit M assosciated with character (e.g. 'A' -> 2, 'D' -> 3)
3. Set the new curNode to the Mth child of curNode. If the Mth child is null, create a new Node and set curNode to it.
4. When we have reached the last character (and consequently the last nested Node), we add the current word to the set of possibleWords of that Node.

```
function initNodeTree(Arg wordSet)
  for each word in wordSet
    curNode = rootNode

    for each char in the word
      M = Digit Associated with char (Compare with a char table, M=-1 if not found, break from loop)
      curNode = Mth child of curNode
      
      if char is the last char
        Add char to possibleWords of curNode
```

After finishing all the words, the end result is a network of nested nodes within a root node, with each nested node (rootNode[digit1][digit2]....) representing the list of possible words when given digits list = [digit1, digit 2...], as well as containing more nested nodes for longer words.

After the initialisation phase, the computer now accepts input from the user. It simply converts the input ('digit1|digit2|digit3 ...') into a digit list ([digit1, digit2, digit3 ...]) and prints out the possibleWords list, that exists at rootNode.children[digit1].children[digit2].children[digit3]...

This described process is much faster than O(4^N) on demand, since the words possible for each digit has already been resolved at the start as the computer(or phone) now just needs to perform a lookup, time complexity O(N). In fact, the rootNode object could be pre-programmed even before runtime so the initialisation of the dictionary doesn't have to be performed at runtime.

```
function getWords(Arg digitArray = [digit1, digit2, digit3 ...])
  curNode = rootNode

  for digit in digitArray
    curNode = digit(index) child of curNode

    if digit is last digit
      // curNode is the final node
      print possibleWords of curNode
```
